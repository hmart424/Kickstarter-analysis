# Kickstarter-Challenge with Excel

## Visual Analysis of diffrent campaigns fared in relation to thier **launch dates** and their **funding goals**

### In todays analysis we figure out many diffrent challenges
  Including diffrent outcomes based on goals and specefic outcomes based on launch dates. Data was filtred based on catagories such as plays and theater and 
  Goal amount from ranges 1000 to 50000. The purpose being finding the best launch date and what perentage goals reached their mark. Todays analysis will provide a clear conclusion.
  
### In todays analysis we learned the most succesful fundrasiers start in **May**, June, or July. On the flipside ***Dec*** proves to be the worst month of the     year to start a fundrasier the ***data*** showing December threw march prove the least success. Also a as far as funding goals the data clearly proves less       than a $1000 and $1000 to $4999 prove to be the most successful goals reached. With $25000 to $29999 being the least succesful. As we can see on the chart        the percentage successful and the percentage failed mirror each other. Some challenges I encountred in the dataset was converting dates.

### My analysis on outcomes based on launch date was the data was heavly skewed towards the month of **May** as being the most succesful. 

  The numbers went down on the success rate every month after that. 

### My analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals was the data mirrior each other meaning the succes rate and failure rate are opposite of each other.
  
  Also not much canceled shows that are ***"plays"***.
  
### Some challenges and Diffuclties I encountred were the data not being broad enough based of categories. Also the dates not being converted.

### My final Analysis on the data is the best time to start a fundrasier is the summer months the worst being the opposite being the winter months and thats by a wide margin. Also the higher your findraiser goals the least chance it being succesful.
